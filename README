textanim8 - text animation
--------------------------


What is this?

textanim8 is a program that uses ncurses to create small animations in your terminal!
in order to make them, you should be able to know C++!


How to make!!

textanim8 (ta8) animations are pretty simple.

the ta8 screen is 50x50 pixels and they are referenced as 49x49

crFrame(std::vector<Frame>& frame_list) - Create a frame
This function will create an empty frame structure and it will push it to the
frame vector that was given.

mdFrame(Frame& frame, int xpos, int ypos, char ch) - Modify a frame's data
This function modifies frame's contents at xpos by ypos. If the function
returns true, then the modification failed (debug purposes only)

dlFrame(std::vector<Frame>& frame_list, int fpos) - Delete a frame
You won't really need this function but it's here for testing purposes. It basically
deletes a frame in frame_list at fpos.

The animation will be in the `anim.cc` file and in order to use it you must re-compile the
program. Feel free to use the existing file as a reference.

Just don't forget to have fun!
